# Infection (L4D2)
Modified version of L4DSwitchPlayers.

When you die, you become an SI.  
After every round or when you get defibbed / rescued, you're back to the survivor team.  
Rescue closets are disabled.

## Installation
Download [infection.smx](https://github.com/boogameow/agent-hunt-l4d2/raw/main/infection.smx) and place it into the Plugins folder in Sourcemod.  
Then, make sure you're subscribed to [the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2916244996) on Steam Workshop.  
Hosting a local server on Campaign (including Mutations), Realism, or Survival is compatible. 

May do some funky things if hosting Versus.  

## Known Issue(s)
- None! :)
