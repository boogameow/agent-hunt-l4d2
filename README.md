# Agent Hunt (L4D2)
Modified version of L4DSwitchPlayers.

When you die, you become an SI.  
On section clear or fail, everyone is back to being a survivor.  
If you get defibbed you change back to a survivor.  

Rescue closets are disabled.  
Download agenthunt.smx and place it into the Plugins folder in Sourcemod.  

# Known Issue(s)
- Being defibbed or rescued correctly switches you back to survivor team, but as a random character.
