# Agent Hunt (L4D2)
Modified version of L4DSwitchPlayers.

When you die, you become an SI.  
Every round or when you get defibbed, you're back to the survivor team.  
Rescue closets are disabled. 
 
Download [agenthunt.smx](https://github.com/boogameow/agent-hunt-l4d2/raw/main/agenthunt.smx) and place it into the Plugins folder in Sourcemod.  

# Known Issue(s)
- Being defibbed or rescued correctly switches you back to survivor team, but as a random character.
