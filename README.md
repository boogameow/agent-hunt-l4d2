# Agent Hunt (L4D2)
Modified version of L4DSwitchPlayers.

When you die, you become an SI.  
Every round or when you get defibbed, you're back to the survivor team.  
Rescue closets are disabled. 

## Installation
Download [agenthunt.smx](https://github.com/boogameow/agent-hunt-l4d2/raw/main/agenthunt.smx) and place it into the Plugins folder in Sourcemod.  
Then, make sure you're subscribed to [the mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2916244996) on Steam Workshop.  
Hosting a local server on Campaign (including Mutations), Realism, or Survival is compatible. 

May do some funky things if hosting Versus.  

## Known Issue(s)
- Being defibbed or rescued correctly switches you back to survivor team, but as a random character.
