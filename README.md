# Agent Hunt (L4D2 Sourcemod)
Modified version of ABM (https://gitlab.com/vbgunz/ABM). Cvars are the exact same as there.

When you die, you become an SI. This works in any mode.
On section clear or fail, everyone is back to being a survivor.
If you get defibbed or rescued you change back to a survivor.

Release includes L4DHooks, which are needed for this to work.
Drag everything inside the zip to the left4dead2 folder.

Make sure you have SourceMod installed correctly.

# Known Issues
- Being defibbed or rescued correctly switches you back to survivor team, but as a random character.
